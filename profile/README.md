# Thank you
Let me start by saying the (hopefully) obvious bit: the [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com) community is one of the best tabletop gaming communities to ever exist and I am deeply humbled by the support you’ve shown me over the last four years.

**So with a heavy heart I am announcing the end of support for [DEATH SAVE DEVELOPMENT](https://github.com/death-save) modules as of today May 26, 2023.**

This means is that I will no longer officially* provide updates or support for any of the following modules:
- [Combat Utility Belt](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/combat-utility-belt)
- [Combat Carousel](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/combat-carousel)
- [Maestro](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/maestro)  
(and any others I have created in the past)

Specifically this means I have no plans for a Foundry VTT V11 update for any of these modules.

I understand this will impact the users of my modules and I apologise for any inconvenience this causes and I welcome interested parties in the community to reach out to me if they would like to take on support and possibly ownership of these modules.

With the success of the Foundry platform, the number of modules is growing every day so I feel the ecosystem is in a place where I can make this decision and not leave game masters and players completely without recourse.

I will keep the [DEATH SAVE Discord](https://discord.gg/wwH7DQc) open for discussion of my modules until such a time as it is no longer needed, so feel free to post your comments via Discord (on the DEATH SAVE or [official Foundry Discord](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt)) or on the [Foundry VTT reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundryVTT/). 

Finally, if you’d like to know more about this decision please read the post script below.

From the bottom of my heart: thank you,  
❤️ e

*what does officially mean? I’m not sure. I may provide an update here and there (no different than now) but I will not be actively supporting the modules.

## P.S. A bit more detail:

My module developer journey started in 2019 when I originally discovered Foundry and requested that Atropos (lead Foundry dev) add some of the features I was used to in Roll20 such as rerolling initiative, which was a script built by Robin Kuiper https://github.com/RobinKuiper/Roll20APIScripts/tree/master/CombatTracker. Atropos said I could “make a mod for that” and although I was a bit taken aback because I wasn’t a dev, I decided I would give it a try. The rest, as they say, is history! 

Through working on Foundry modules I found a passion for development and honed my JavaScript skills. In July 2019, my first module “Reroll Initiative” was released! From there I continued to learn and built a number of modules covering different use cases within Foundry. In September 2019 I released my first mega-module: “Combat Utility Belt”. CUB as it became known, slowly grew and found more and more users as time went on, at one point being present in over 40% all Foundry instances based on The Forge VTT’s module stats ([CUB on the Forge](https://forge-vtt.com/bazaar#type=module&package=combat-utility-belt)).

Other modules came such as Maestro and Combat Carousel, and in 2020 I launched a Patreon with a mind to try and make module development my career. Unfortunately that didn’t pan out, but I was blessed to have a number of patrons who continued to support DEATH SAVE DEVELOPMENT up until the closure of my Patreon earlier this year.

So while this began as a labour of love, changes in my life and career as well as increasing scope and support requirements have slowly drained out the love part, leaving only the labour. I am now in a place where every time I try to open up my code I am hit with a wave of anxiety about all the things that need to be done and I find myself unable to move forward.

Although this doesn’t necessarily excuse my decision, I hope it helps provide you with some clarity into it.
